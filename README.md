My config files to use in different environments

To install the configs you must have `stow` installed

In arch `pacman -S stow`
In mac `brew install stow`

```bash
stow <folder>

# for example
stow neovim
```

## Arch setup

```
== TODO ==
```

## Mac setup

`brew` is required

```bash
brew install zsh neofetch antigen starship pyenv pyenv-virtualenv lsd
```
